We\u2019ve also deployed some drop pods for the less\u2026 social, of our crewmembers. And, well...\u201D A chuckle can be heard. \u201CI have considered joining them on the planet, to oversee operations and manage the chain of command.  This has been my first deployment in many years. I\u2019m not going to sit back and rot on the bridge like some old hardware. That said...\u201D\r\n\r\nThe old man clears his throat, getting back on topic. \u201CThe shuttles landed in a mountainous region, along some cliffs. While disembarking and setting up a rallypoint, we came under attack from local fauna, just as reports detailed. The situation quickly escalated, and within the first 24 hours we have sustained major casualties and injuries.\u201D\r\n\r\n \u201CThankfully the ammunition and armaments I requested were granted by UES, as more of the crew has reported back that all outer life encountered thus far has been hostile. Some of our ground forces have also reported strange and irregular natural phenomenon.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe old man gazes out of the window of his cabin, the moon shining in the night sky. \u201CWhat a strange planet. This\u2019ll certainly make a good story.\u201D",

I find myself in the middle of a desert - with no other survivors in sight. I scavenged for resources, but soon giant insects began to crawl out of the earth and take aggressive stances. Once they gathered their numbers - and presumably their confidence - they charged me. \r\n\r\nIn avoiding their assault, I slipped and fell backwards into a waterfall of mysterious liquid. I tumbled within as it rushed me down, deep into an underground cavern. I crawled out, and thankfully the insects have stopped following me. I may have broken my leg - but thankfully CHIT(?) I have a healing drone to administer aid. It will take a few days to get my strength back. \r\n\r\n<style=cMono>Day 1<\/style>\r\nI am grateful that I repaired this drone before my untimely tumble - I would assuredly be dead without it. My vision is blurry - I fear I have also suffered a CHIT concussion. My leg has begun to feel better. I will have to continue to wait. I grow hungry.\r\n\r\n<style=cMono>Day 2<\/style>\r\nMy healing drone has stopped giving me aid. It hovers far away now - and moves back as I move forward. I've been feeling nauseous, and have been feeling the urge to CHIT CHIT vomit. I occasionally spit out black liquid - I fear something is gravely wrong.\r\n\r\n<style=cMono>Day 3<\/style>\r\nMy CHIT CHIT drone has left.  I have CHIT lost my vision.

The plateau is littered with giant stone rings and arcs - hundreds of feet tall. We investigated them first after landing but we couldn't discern anything of interest.\r\n\r\nWe were making room for a com-center in our camp, and one of our MUL-T bots were in charge of clearing out some of the bigger boulders. It was easiest to just push them off the edge of the plateau. \r\n\r\nNot a minute later, we heard a deep rumble - and saw something unbelievable. It just... flew. One of the stone rings - a smaller one - began to groan and lift out of the earth, moving with unknown forces. And then it lifted into the air, slowly spinning. It hovered to a height of about 200 feet, and then stopped.\r\n\r\nAs it spun, something began to form in the center of the ring. Specks of dirt tumbled in the air, until it formed a pebble, then a small rock, then a boulder. An identical boulder to the one we just moved - created out of thin air. Despite being constructed only a moment ago, the boulder was worn and covered in moss and lichen like it has been around for centuries.\r\n\r\nThen, the stone fell to the ground with an unceremonious crash - right on top of our coms relay.\r\n\r\nNot too long after, the stone ring began to waver. Then, like the invisible strings holding it in place were cut, the ring also fell to the earth.  Crash. \r\n\r\nWe stopped moving stuff around after that.\r\n\r\n<style=cMono>Local audio transcriptions complete.<\/style>\r\n",

I had no choice. Marion knew - and she was always so much stronger. So much stronger than all of us.\r\n\r\nAnd it worked, it really did! Marion saved all of us. The dagger - it saved Pugh and Larsen and Dillon. Carney and Stevens.\r\n\r\nBut Pugh saw - he saw and he didn't understand. How could he? I tried to tell him - I ran over to him. But I couldn't convince him otherwise, and he was so crazy - so crazy! He wouldn't shut up and the golems were coming and the dagger - there was no choice.\r\n\r\nEveryone was real somber that night. We lost Hitchcock and Marion and Pugh. Real somber. Later on, Carney found the book from a nearby chest. And it really all made sense - it did! I knew why Marion had that dagger and why I had to be the one to kill her. And Carney? He was too strong. I couldn't risk him not understanding. He wouldn't understand.\r\n\r\nBut Carney was big. Everyone else would've known. So that night, after I killed him, I went and took his body to the Altar. And I hid the Altar - right at the edge of the cliff, between two clusters of roots, in a cave underneath. And in that cave... I worshipped Her Concepts.\r\n\r\nThe rest? Well, they were so old and so tired. They were just gifts for N'kuhana. And She loved them. \r\n\r\nWeshan.\r\n<style=cMono>\r\nLocal audio transcriptions complete.\r\n<\/style>\r\n",
