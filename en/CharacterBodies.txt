It folded neatly unto itself and began rolling down the hangar's exit lane - at a very safe pace.\r\n\r\nHiroshi pulled a switch. The ceiling rail sprung to life, with a distinct mechanical chatter.\r\n\r\n\"So, what's wrong with this one?\" Rico enquired with minimal interest, seemingly distracted by the novel he had buried himself in.\r\n\r\n\"Looks like cosmetic damage on a MUL-T unit. Got dinged up by another unit in the charging bay that malfunctioned after another power surge. We'll be checking that one out after this. You can thank the electrical crew for that,\" Hiroshi remarked. \r\n\r\n\"Great. How hard is it for them to just keep things stable? They have robots doing 90% of their job anyway.\" Rico scoffed.\r\n\r\n\"We've got complaints on this unit about poor welding jobs, which might've been the cause. Optical calibration is probably off, so we'll also be taking a look at that while it's here. I'd still put money on it being electrical not keeping up with maintenance. Hey, Rico! Would you put that down and help me out?\"\r\n\r\nThe rail brought a bright yellow robot, slumbering, into the hangar. Hiroshi flipped the switch and the rail slowed to a halt, bringing with it silence. He began moving to unhook the robot. Reluctantly, Rico set his book on the work desk and started to help unload. In a few minutes the robot was on the service platform.\r\n\r\nHiroshi walked over to one of the tool cabinets and pulled out a strange device. He popped open the access panel to the unit's dented head, and began probing at the damage from the opposite side. In no time at all, the tool beeped and kicked back violently. The dent was gone.\r\n\r\n\"Go put this away while I fix the optics,\" Hiroshi said, one arm stretched behind his back, device in hand. \"I have something I want to show you in a sec.\"\r\n\r\nRico grunted and took the de-denting tool back to the cabinet. Hiroshi was already soldering away with the iron from his pocket.\r\n\r\nThis caught Rico's interest. \r\n\r\n\"You don't need a soldering iron to fix the calibration. What are you doing?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I already fixed the optics. Remember when I said I wanted to show you something cool - the next time we got a MUL-T in the shop? Come here.\" said Hiroshi, gesturing. \"You see these two chips? It\u2019s actually just one chip that's been split. MUL-T\u2019s come with the same cores as those fancy chef bots, but they cut off access to the main learning module.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't say,\" Rico responded, still trying to see the chip Hiroshi was talking about. \"Why'd they do something like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's cheaper to just make all the cores the same way at the factory and alter them later. The manufacturer says it's for safety, but they just use it to sell you the new cores every few years instead of letting you just teach the units to do a new job.\" Hiroshi explained.\r\n\r\n\"Sounds about right. If it were a safety issue, why don't they do the same thing with the chef bots? They've been super stable. Can't say they've even ever got an order wrong, even if it's totally out there. They even managed to get Ma's Squid Risotto right.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's what they can get away with. Anyway, that should do it. We'll just sneak a few minutes with this guy. Wake up,\" he commanded.\r\n\r\nThe robot's relaxed posture disappeared, and it stood fully alert.\r\n\r\n\"Hey pal, you see this thing I'm doing with my hand? Can you do that?\"\r\n\r\nThe robot mimicked a rude gesture.\r\n\r\n\"That's fantastic! You're doing great!\" Hiroshi was excited, and Rico got a devilish grin. He rushed off to his desk. Hiroshi continued repeating the gesture, and the robot continued mimicking it back with its single functional hand. Rico stepped back into the robot's view, with a picture covered in holes. \"Can you remember this man? This is Ron from corporate, and he's a total degenerate.\"\r\n\r\nThe robot beeped in affirmation.\r\n\r\n\"Can you do that next time you see this man?\"\r\n\r\nThe robot beeped in affirmation again.\r\n\r\n\"Rico! He's gonna remember that! MUL-T, forget that.\"\r\n\r\nThe robot did not respond.\r\n\r\n\"What are you two up to now?\" said a grating voice, clearly approaching from no discernable direction. In a panic, Hiroshi slapped the access panel on the unit's head closed and covered its optical sensor.\r\n\r\n\"Just fixing up robots! Doing our job! In fact, we just finished with this one.

I have assigned their common name as \u2018Worker Beetle\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u2022 About the size of a small cow. Quadruped, with two large front-limbs. Moves similar to an earthen gorilla. Five eyes.\r\n\r\n\u2022 The Beetle has two armor-like chitin plates on its head and back, presumably for defense. It seems to secrete a waxy substance.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Beetles appear to be social in nature, with a hierarchy I cannot discern. I witnessed a group of 4 beetles resting under a tree, when a stray fifth came around. They promptly sprang up and repeatedly head-butted the creature until it left, battered and bruised.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Tharson has reported to me that the Beetles are highly aggressive and territorial. \r\n",

I have assigned their common name as \u2018Beetle Guard\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Much greater in size than their smaller cousins, the Guard is the size of a rhinoceroses. The Guard has the same 5 eyes as the Worker's, with one of them protruding from the top of its head. This most likely allows the Guard to see while keeping its head down in a defensive position.\r\n\r\n\u2022 The Guard appears higher in the social hierarchy than the Worker. I have witnessed Workers scatter when a Guard appeared.\r\n\r\n\u2022 The Guard\u2019s chitin plates extend to cover its entire body, with only joints revealing the thinner, darker exoskeleton below. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Tharson has reported that the Guard\u2019s chitin is significantly sturdier than the Workers. We have consumed many resources to fell this magnificent creature, including our disposable missile launcher.

While the air is breathable, it is no blessing; we have been unable to escape the foul smell that we can only now assume is simply a part of the atmosphere on this world. Worst of all, attempts to return through the portal have been unsuccessful in our weakened state. It takes considerable effort to enter [the between space] - and we lack the strength to stay there long enough to cross the membrane. We are stranded.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is the master of this world. Curiously, it is in his presence that we find ourselves most weakened - and when he senses us, he wastes no time in his approach. We've attempted to kill him once in the hopes of restoring our access to the portal, and it ended in such disaster that it became clear there could not be a second attempt. If not for our ability to briefly dive into [the between space] to escape our skirmishes, we would surely all be butchered.\r\n\r\nWhenever we can observe him unnoticed, he stands in the open, transfixed by the moon. I find some small humor in that.\r\n\r\nCurse this place - and curse its master.

I have assigned their common name as \u2018Icarian Jellyfish\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Large, round invertebrate, about 2m in diameter, with two trailing tentacles. They shimmer a white-blue. They greatly resemble Medusozoa from Earth. \r\n\r\n\u2022 They seem to be experiencing neutral buoyancy in this planet\u2019s atmosphere, causing them to float. I theorize this is due to a unique gas composition inside of their hull, which they expel to traverse.\r\n\r\n\u2022 When observed, these Jellyfish seem to bathe in the sun, slowly rotating their bodies as they do so. They may be cold-blooded.\r\n\r\n\u2022 By my request, Tharson approached a lone Jellyfish. After detecting his presence, it began to glow, quiver, and pulse before suddenly detonating with a brilliant flash and a loud bang, causing severe burns and temporary blindness to Tharson. I theorize that by exciting the gases inside of their hulls, these Jellyfish can ignite those gases and explode, scorching everything nearby. Tharson is OK from this encounter.\r\n",

They constantly emit a low ringing sound from a bell-like device at their core, and their accuracy was substantially affected after Tharson landed a clean blow on the bell, denting the device.\r\n\r\n* They are constructed of an alien alloy currently under investigation by our friends on the science team. It resembles Earthen brass, yet appears to have durability and toughness more resembling steel.\r\n\r\n* How the Contraptions function is still a mystery, as they possess no circuitry or onboard computers.

It came out of thin air and started tapping along the perimeter with one of its forelegs - like it was checking for an opening. It'd check a few meters at a time, and then disappear. Again, and again.\r\n\r\nSo, I figured out its pattern.\r\n\r\nI waited for it, where it would appear next. My rifle was aimed at empty space - and then suddenly, that empty space became a target. But I couldn't pull the trigger. \r\n\r\nIt turned to look straight at me, and I was paralyzed. It wasn't fear, it was something else. It was talking into my brain. The words it used weren't any language I knew, but it compelled me to freeze. The experience wasn't something I can fully describe with words. I couldn't pull the trigger. I couldn't even reach for the radio. I couldn't turn to look away. While my head was ringing, it resumed its routine; I could only stand and watch. It finished its check, and then returned its attention to me, as though I were an afterthought. I could feel it take something from me, but I can't remember what it was. And then, it left.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that it got whatever it wanted, because it hasn't been back since.\r\n\r\nSomething is still wrong with my head. I can't even seem to work up the power to speak. Should I even tell anyone? Is knowing somehow worse?\r\n\r\nAnd what about all those times I heard that same sound - before I ever came to this awful place?",

Furthen, naturalist for the UES [Redacted] in conjunction with the UES Research and Documentation of Outer Life. I am joined by my good friend Tharson, who is keeping me safe through this journey.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nWhile assessing our landing site and the small ghostly creatures that now lay, unfortunately flat, under our ship, we heard loud booming footsteps approaching. We stepped away to observe this lifeform\u2019s behavior from afar.\r\n\r\nI will describe its properties below. I have assigned their common name as \u2018Parent\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Tall, lumbering giants, eerily humanoid. Where you would expect to see a face there is only a hole, giving a blank look to them. Their ghostly skin appears to run like wax but even so it does not seem to congeal at their feet.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Their large hands have opposable thumbs. This could possibly mean that they have the capability for intelligence, using tools or testing their environment with dextrous manipulation.\r\n\r\n\u2022 If we hadn\u2019t taken up this vantage point when we did, the creature would have been upon us before we realized it. Its distant footstep sounds betrayed how quickly it closed the distance.\r\n\r\n\u2022 I had Tharson throw a stone near the creature and suddenly any signs of intelligence faded, replaced with primal fury. Deadly, wild force rained down as it smashed the ground with its fists, searching for the perpetrator of its peaceful moment. Our ship was not OK from this encounter.\r\n",

I am joined by my good friend Tharson, who is keeping me safe through this journey.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nOn a routine food gathering trek we happened upon a vast fungal grove with towering fungi. Thinking we would take some samples back to test if they were edible, we noticed some of the smaller variety sprout up from the ground and circle around us.\r\n\r\nI will describe its properties below. I have assigned their common name as \u2018Mini Mushrum\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u2022 \u2018Mini\u2019 is a relative term here, as these mobile mushrooms were larger than Tharson. The subtle glow on the underside of their cap is probably to scare away predators, advertising that they are dangerous to eat.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Waddling around on short, stubby legs makes them seem quite unsuited for walking. They comically bump into things as they fret about. Perhaps their eyeseight is poor from living in the dark?\r\n\r\n\u2022 After a long time studying their movements, I suggested to Tharson to retrieve a sample from one to take back with us. The one that the sample was taken from began to flee as the others began shaking, spilling their spores into the air. Our air filtration warnings went off so we left before the cloud of fungal gas became too overwhelming. We did not eat the sample.\r\n",

I have assigned her common name as \u201CBeetle Queen\u201D.\r\n\r\n* Just like other insect queens, the Beetle Queen dwarves her subjects. However, her size is much greater than it should be for an insect queen. Does this mean that the Queen herself hunts rather than sending her drones?\r\n\r\n* The Beetle Queen issues orders via pheromone emission. Merely being in the presence of the Queen gave the air a sickly sweet aroma, and Tharson reported light-headedness and trouble thinking clearly.\r\n\r\n* The Queen\u2019s bile is incredibly acidic, clocking in at a whopping 0.05 on the pH scale. Immediately upon exposure to a test sample of steel, it began to dissolve and spew noxious fumes. Tharson is OK from this encounter.\r\n\r\n* The Queen is able to summon unique Beetle specimens that can fly. These drones do not appear anywhere else on the planet \u2013 do these drones act as attendants to the Queen? Observing these flying drones is challenging \u2013 they only seem to last for a few seconds before expiring.\r\n",

A relative of the previously documented Icarian Jellyfish, this specimen dwarves its brethren several times over.\r\n\r\nI will describe its properties below. I have assigned its common name as \u201CIcarian Vagrant\u201D.\r\n\r\n* Massive in size. I wouldn\u2019t believe the Vagrant is capable of flight had I not seen it myself. Like its smaller cousin, the Vagrant\u2019s hull contains buoyant gases that allow it to fly. \r\n\r\n* These gases are easily excitable and produce incredible amounts of static electricity, cloaking the Vagrant in a protective aura that scorches anything that approaches. The Vagrants can also hurl charged nematocysts as a method of self-defense, as evidenced when I asked Tharson to approach a lone Vagrant. Tharson is OK from this encounter.\r\n\r\n* The name of \u201CVagrant\u201D was decided on by its nomadic nature. We trailed a lone specimen for several days. The Vagrant would wander from place to place, occasionally dipping down towards the ground to feel around with its tentacles. After a few minutes, it would ascend and continue on its path. Could the Vagrant be looking for something, indicating intelligence, or is this merely a hunting method?\r\n\r\n* When the clouds part, dozens of Vagrants can be seen lazily drifting throughout the sky, twinkling like stars. Despite their beauty, it raises a horrifying question \u2013 are the stars at night on this planet truly stars, or just more Vagrants? The answer can spell truly horrifying implications for our stay on this planet.",

After a brief quake, a massive serpentine creature, easily 50 feet long, erupted from the ground and arced through the air, knocking us off our feet. I will describe its properties below. I have assigned their common name as \u201CMagma Worm\u201D.\r\n\r\n* Upon inspection of its (now dead) body, I discovered multiple ports along its skin. These ports must allow it to propel itself forward, releasing a gaseous exhaust that is then ignited to give the worm its fiery appearance.\r\n\r\n* The size of the creature is something to behold. It must wield an incredible amount of energy, as the heat radiating off its body was enough to turn the earth it burrows through into smooth, glassy tunnels. It must either eat an incredible amount of food, or spend a long time hibernating under ground.\r\n\r\n* The worm\u2019s body is incredibly conductive, retaining temperatures of over 350 degrees Fahrenheit for over ten hours after the beast was felled.\r\n\r\n* It appears that the worm is classically blind \u2013 what appear to be eyes are revealed to be symbiotes that grant the worm vision in exchange for protection against predators. How fascinating! I wonder how this relationship came about.\r\n",

They are hostile on sight, but we hope to follow them back to their dens and observe their behavior when not hunting. I have assigned their common name as \"Radkari Blind Vermin\".\n\n* As their name suggests, the Vermin are blind, relying primarily on their acute senses of smell and hearing to navigate their environment.\n\n* They leave behind trails of body waste as they scurry to and fro, and other Vermin follow these trails, much like Earth ants' pheromones. Could these creatures be descended from insects?\n\n* The Vermin are weak individually, and thus live in communal dens, typically buried in hillsides or foxholes.\n\n* Their terrible odor cannot be understated. Even through our suits' filters, we could still smell a foul odor, reminiscent of rotting flesh and excrement. I will not have Tharson disable his filters, despite my curiosity.",

Their major difference, of course, was their ability to fly! I have assigned their common name as \"Radkari Blind Pest\".\n\n* Much like their earthbound cousins, the Pests are blind and rely heavily on their smell and hearing. However, their pronounced tongue may indicate that they may use taste to identify things as well.\n\n* The Pests' primary characteristic is their ability to fly. Alongside this, they also weaponize their acidic bile as a projectile attack. This could allow them to partially digest their prey as they hunt... How fascinatingly foul.\n\n* They typically inhabit warmer, damper areas, like jungles. After our skirmish, I noted nests in the canopy. This indicates that the Pests are ambush predators, waiting for prey to waltz below their nests.",

But the Tar still hungered.\n\nRiding down on a falling star, the Tar spread to the unsuspecting world of Aphelia.\n\nThe Tar offered its power to the dunepeople, promising them energy and sustenance. The dunepeople, hungry and battered from life in the harsh desert, accepted.\n\nThe Tar didn't ask for much. The Tar only asked that the dunepeople spread it across Aphelia, so the Tar may feed. And so it did; the dunepeople crafted elaborate clay vessels to carry the Tar to and fro. Mighty aqueducts, belching forth black rivers of Tar, dotted the skyline. Those who pleased the Tar were blessed with its gift; a connection. They were one with the Tar.\n\nAnd it was in this reverence that the dunepeople began to look back. The lush riversides, consumed. The animals that served as livestock and steed, drowned in Tar. The Tar had consumed everything, even the dunepeople themselves. They were nothing more than extensions of the Tar's will.\n\nAnd when the Tar asked for more, the dunepeople had nothing more to give.\n\nOnly a mighty hero, riding down from heaven on a glowing blue dragon, offered the dunepeople a chance at salvation.

Tharson, upon impact, was stuck to the beast and was briefly submerged in the Gup's slime. Tharson was left mostly unscathed from this encounter, though is reporting signs of dizzyness.\n\n* The Gup's slime is intensely aromatic, smelling much like strawberry and other fruits. Could this be a hunting tactic, luring prey in, only for them to be stuck in the Gup's slimy trap?\n\n* I had Tharson taste-test the Gup's slime, for science. Tharson reported an intensely bitter flavor, despite the pleasant aroma. Tharson is vomiting after this encounter, but is largely OK.",

I have assigned their common name as \"Forhamian Acid Tick.\"\n\n* The Ticks' biology is dominated by a bile sac, which not only stores acidic bile but also houses their eggs.\n\n* When threatened, the Ticks produce bile at an accelerated rate, filling their bile sacs to burst - literally. I've noted some specimens capable of producing blasts of acid with a range of up to 3 meters in diameter.\n\n\* When they burst, their acid provides an avenue for newly hatched larvae to bury into prey and feast on their nutrient-rich meat.\n\n\* Their acute senses prevent predators from sneaking up on them. On top of this, the creatures exhibit automimicry, their false head spewing acidic bile onto would-be attackers, leaving enough time for the Tick to escape.",
