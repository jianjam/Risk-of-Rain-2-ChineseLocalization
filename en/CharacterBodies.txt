Furthen, naturalist for the UESC [Redacted] in conjunction with the UESC Research and Documentation of Outer Life. I am joined by my good friend Tharson, who is keeping me safe through this journey.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nWe have encountered more outer life - what a wonderful surprise! As we scavenged for food, the ground began to shift, and many large insect-like creatures began to burrow out from the ground. \r\n\r\nI will describe its properties below. I have assigned their common name as \u2018Worker Beetle\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u2022 About the size of a small cow. Quadruped, with two large front-limbs. Moves similar to an earthen gorilla. Five eyes.\r\n\r\n\u2022 The Beetle has two armor-like chitin plates on its head and back, presumably for defense. It seems to secrete a waxy substance.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Beetles appear to be social in nature, with a hierarchy I cannot discern. I witnessed a group of 4 beetles resting under a tree, when a stray fifth came around. They promptly sprang up and repeatedly head-butted the creature until it left, battered and bruised.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Tharson has reported to me that the Beetles are highly aggressive and territorial. \r\n",

I am joined by my good friend Tharson, who is keeping me safe through this journey.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nAmazing! We have witnessed our first ever eusocial creature outside of Earth. I observe from afar a giant cousin of the previously described Worker Beetles. \r\n\r\nI will describe its properties below. I have assigned their common name as \u2018Beetle Guard\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Much greater in size than their smaller cousins, the Guard is the size of a rhinoceroses. The Guard has the same 5 eyes as the Worker's, with one of them protruding from the top of its head. This most likely allows the Guard to see while keeping its head down in a defensive position.\r\n\r\n\u2022 The Guard appears higher in the social hierarchy than the Worker. I have witnessed Workers scatter when a Guard appeared.\r\n\r\n\u2022 The Guard\u2019s chitin plates extend to cover its entire body, with only joints revealing the thinner, darker exoskeleton below. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Tharson has reported that the Guard\u2019s chitin is significantly sturdier than the Workers. We have consumed many resources to fell this magnificent creature, including our disposable missile launcher. Tharson\u2019s battle with the Guard lasted for about an hour before it finally succumbed. Amazing! Tharson is OK from this encounter.",

I am joined by my good friend Tharson, who is keeping me safe through this journey.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nToday, we\u2019ve seen our first form of outer life on this planet, merely a few hours after our untimely landing.\r\n\r\nI will describe its properties below. I have assigned their common name as \u2018Icarian Jellyfish\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Large, round invertebrate, about 1m in diameter, with two trailing tentacles. They shimmer a white-blue. They greatly resemble Medusozoa from Earth. \r\n\r\n\u2022 They seem to be experiencing neutral buoyancy in this planet\u2019s atmosphere, causing them to float. I theorize this is due to a unique gas composition inside of their hull, which they expel to traverse.\r\n\r\n\u2022 When observed, these Jellyfish seem to bathe in the sun, slowly rotating their bodies as they do so. They may be cold-blooded.\r\n\r\n\u2022 By my request, Tharson approached a lone Jellyfish. After detecting his presence, it began to glow, quiver, and pulse before suddenly detonating with a brilliant flash and a loud bang, causing severe burns and temporary blindness to Tharson. I theorize that by exciting the gases inside of their hulls, these Jellyfish can ignite those gases and explode, scorching everything nearby. Tharson is OK from this encounter.\r\n",

I am joined by my good friend Tharson, who is keeping me safe through this journey.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nWhile assessing our landing site and the small ghostly creatures that now lay, unfortunately flat, under our ship, we heard loud booming footsteps approaching. We stepped away to observe this lifeform\u2019s behavior from afar.\r\n\r\nI will describe its properties below. I have assigned their common name as \u2018Parent\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Tall, lumbering giants, eerily humanoid. Where you would expect to see a face there is only a hole, giving a blank look to them. Their ghostly skin appears to run like wax but even so it does not seem to congeal at their feet.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Their large hands have opposable thumbs. This could possibly mean that they have the capability for intelligence, using tools or testing their environment with dextrous manipulation.\r\n\r\n\u2022 If we hadn\u2019t taken up this vantage point when we did, the creature would have been upon us before we realized it. It\u2019s distant footstep sounds betrayed how quickly it closed the distance.\r\n\r\n\u2022 I had Tharson throw a stone near the creature and suddenly any signs of intelligence faded, replaced with primal fury. Deadly, wild force rained down as it smashed the ground with its fists, searching for the perpetrator of its peaceful moment. Our ship was not OK from this encounter.\r\n",

Furthen, naturalist for the UESC [Redacted] in conjunction with the UESC Research and Documentation of Outer Life. I am joined by my good friend Tharson, who is keeping me safe through this journey.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nOn a routine food gathering trek we happened upon a vast fungal grove with towering fungi. Thinking we would take some samples back to test if they were edible, we noticed some of the smaller variety sprout up from the ground and circle around us.\r\n\r\nI will describe its properties below. I have assigned their common name as \u2018Mini Mushrum\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u2022 \u2018Mini\u2019 is a relative term here, as these mobile mushrooms were larger than Tharson. The subtle glow on the underside of their cap is probably to scare away predators, advertising that they are dangerous to eat.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Waddling around on short, stubby legs makes them seem quite unsuited for walking. They comically bump into things as they fret about. Perhaps their eyeseight is poor from living in the dark?\r\n\r\n\u2022 After a long time studying their movements, I suggested to Tharson to retrieve a sample from one to take back with us. The one that the sample was taken from began to flee as the others began shaking, spilling their spores into the air. Our air filtration warnings went off so we left before the cloud of fungal gas became too overwhelming. We did not eat the sample.\r\n",
